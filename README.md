## Battleship game
Simple command line battleship game with two players, created with Java.

#### What was the purpose of this project?
With this project, I wanted to understand how to develop such as complex program, as a game.
My learning goals were to practice principles of OOP, to learn how to handle exceptions and how to process user input.

#### What was my learning outcome? 
I learn from this project: 
* How to provide code extensibility by implementing method overriding 
* What is runtime polymorphism
* How to reduce error and improve readability of your code with enum types.
* How to reuse the code via composition
* How to control run-time errors with exceptions

Moreover, I practiced:
* functional decomposition 
* writing pseudocode
* debugging techniques
